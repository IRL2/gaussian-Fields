# gaussian-Fields

This project has been successfully built with the following:
1.  Visual studio 2019 or Xcode 14
2.  openFrameworks of_v0.11.2_vs2017_release

The way that I build this project is as follows:
1.  Download from https://openframeworks.cc/download/ the latest windows version of openFrameworks
    (i downloaded of_v0.11.2_vs2017_release.zip, either for windows or Mac depending what you are using)
2.  Extract the zip
3.  Within the directory of_v0.11.2_vs2017_release, navigate to the directory /examples/math
4.  Clone the gaussian-Fields repo so that it sides alongside the other math examples
5.  Within the gaussian-Fields repo, open the .sln file (if using VS) or the .xcodeproj file (if using Xcode)
6.  Build the project
7.  Run the project
8.  If you get a VS error when you try to run, try setting gaussianFields as the single startup project
    * right click "Solution 'gaussianFields'" in the VS solution explorer
    * -> Properties
    * select 'Single Startup Project', and indicate 'gaussianFields'

Running:
1.  Pressing 'r' reinitializes the attractors & the particles
2.  Pressing 'f' zeros out the forces for as long as 'f' is pressed
3.  If you run into performance issues, reduce within ofApp.cpp the number of attractors 'nattractors' & number of particles 'nparticles'
4.  Have fun!
